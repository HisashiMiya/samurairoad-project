IMAGENESIS
Become a PICTOMANCER.

概要（Short Description）

Create monsters from images.
Fight with dice, skills, and probability.

IMAGENESIS is a turn-based experimental RPG where images become living creatures.
You are a PICTOMANCER — a mage who gives form and power to visual data.

About This Game

IMAGENESIS is a small, experimental RPG built around a simple question:

What happens if an image becomes a creature?

Upload an image.
The game analyzes it and generates a unique monster with its own stats and skills.
No two monsters are the same.

Battles are turn-based and dice-driven.
Luck matters — but understanding probability, timing, and skill conditions matters more.

This is not a fast action game.
It is a game about reading outcomes, accepting randomness, and making decisions under uncertainty.
